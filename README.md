# CFA050_PI_M

## Hardware Introduction

The Crystalfonzt CFA050-PI-M series of modules are primarily based around a 5-inch TFT LCD panel, and a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4).
The module can be purchased with no touch screen, a resistive touch screen, or a multi-touch capacitive screen.
The use of a Raspberry Pi CM4 (instead of a normal full-sized Pi 4) makes for a very compact, robust and versatile computing or HMI module.

Features include:
+ 5 inch TFT, 1280x720 pixel, high-brightness display
+ Multi-touch capacitive, resistive or no touch screen options
+ [Raspberry Pi CM4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4/) based (quad-core 64bit SoC @ 1.5GHz, 1/2/4/8GB RAM options, microSD or 8/16/32GB eMMC storage options)
+ A full Raspberry Pi standard 40 pin IO header
+ Compact expansion header access to PCI-E, HDMI, SPI and Ethernet
+ An extra six GPIO lines from an on-board I2C IO expander IC
+ Battery backed up real time clock
+ Flexible power supply options (barrel-jack, Micro USB or PCB header)

## Linux / RaspberryPi OS Setup

The official [Raspberry Pi OS distribution](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) as of the May 3rd 2023 release includes support for the Crystalfontz CFA050-PI-M modules.
